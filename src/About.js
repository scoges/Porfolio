        My name is Scott Ogrins. Originally an electronics technologist for the Canadian forces, I have spent the past twenty years
        educating and improving myself to truly integrate technology with the world we live in. The final piece of the engineering puzzle I
        am attempting to create is code development. I plan to demonstrate my learning path through this portfolio page.
